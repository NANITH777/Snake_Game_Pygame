# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating apple to grow longer. The game is designed to be fun and educational, offering a great exercise in Python programming.

## Description

The game involves controlling a snake that moves around a grid. The goal is to eat fruits to make the snake grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake itself. The more fruits you eat, the longer the snake becomes and the more challenging the game gets.

## Features

- Control the snake with the arrow keys.
- The game records your score and level based on the snake's length.
- On-screen instructions to help new players.
- Music and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- The game ends when a collision with a wall or the snake itself occurs.
